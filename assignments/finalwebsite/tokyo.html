            <h2>Temple History</h2>
            <p>"On Sunday, July 17, 1949, Elder Matthew Cowley made the first prophecy regarding the Tokyo Japan Temple
                at the dedicatory services for the old Tokyo mission home—the site where the temple now stands. Elder
                Harrison Ted Price, a missionary serving in the Northern Far East Mission, recorded in his journal: "In
                this prayer, he told of countless blessings from the Lord that have been enjoyed here to date, and went
                on to prophesy—'there will someday be many church buildings—and even TEMPLES built in the land.'"<br>

                President Spencer W. Kimball announced the building of the temple at a Tokyo area conference held August
                9, 1975. The audience reacted with spontaneous applause followed by tears of appreciation while they
                held their hands high to sustain the proposal.<br>

                Mission President Harrison T. Price, who was present as a missionary for Elder Cowley's dedication of
                the mission home and prophecy of the temple in 1949, was called to supervise demolition of mission
                headquarters to make way for the temple.<br>

                One of the contractors was suprised to learn the building project was a temple. He recognized that the
                Buddhist and Shinto religions built shrines and temples and that Christian churches built meetinghouses
                and cathedrals, but he had never heard of a Christian church building a temple. He was told the temple
                would be "a sacred building, a holy house, where the glorious work of salvation for the living and the
                dead would be carried out, where baptisms for the dead and other ordinances would be performed to bring
                about the joining of wife to husband, children to parents, for the living as well as the dead, and where
                families would be sealed together for time and for all eternity."<br>

                On December 10, 2004, an angel Moroni statue was added to the spire of the temple, as witnessed by
                hundreds of applauding onlookers. Although rain was forecasted for the 10th, the day was beautiful and
                clear. The scaffolding was taken down the following week, revealing a more beautiful and magnificent
                temple than before." -ChurchofJesusChristTemples.org</p>

            <p>The Tokyo Japan Temple closed on September 29, 2017, for an extensive renovation project that will
                include significant changes to the interior, exterior, and auxiliary buildings. The historic temple, the
                first in Asia, was dedicated in 1980. The renovation will be followed by a public open house and
                rededication ceremony. Temple patrons will be accommodated at the Fukuoka Japan Temple and Sapporo Japan
                Temple.</p>
